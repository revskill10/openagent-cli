**Run it**:
```bash
npx tsx examples/durable-codebase-analysis.ts run /path/to/codebase ./analysis-output
```

### 2. Context-Aware Code Chat System
**File**: `context-aware-code-chat.ts`
**Purpose**: AI assistant that understands your entire codebase

**What it does**:
- Indexes your codebase using GraphRAG

- Pattern consistency checking

**Run it**:
```bash
npx tsx examples/context-aware-code-chat.ts start /path/to/codebase

# Interactive session:
üë§ You: How does user authentication work in this codebase?
ü§ñ Based on your codebase, here's how authentication works...

üë§ You: Refactor the UserService class to be more maintainable
ü§ñ Here are refactoring suggestions based on your patterns...
```

### 3. Agentic Coding Workflow
**File**: `agentic-coding-workflow.ts`  
**Purpose**: Multiple AI agents collaborating on complex coding tasks

**What it does**:
- **Architect Agent**: Designs system architecture
- **Developer Agent**: Implements features following best practices

- Code modernization projects
- Technical debt reduction
- Best practices enforcement
- Quality assurance automation

**Run it**:
```bash
npx tsx examples/agentic-coding-workflow.ts run /path/to/codebase

# Agents work together to:
# 1. Design architecture for new feature
# 2. Implement following project patterns  
# 3. Review for security and quality
# 4. Generate comprehensive tests
# 5. Optimize performance
# 6. Create documentation
```
